      Man has been exposed to changing surroundings ever since he came into
      existence. He has been quite interested in learning about his surroundings
      and studying and explaining the things that are happening around him. He
      has conducted experiments and observations to gather information as a
      result of his interest. Through the decades, it has also been in charge of
      many people’s research endeavours around the globe. Systematizing and
      organising the knowledge acquired in this way was absolutely necessary for
      the good of humanity.
    </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
      Science is the name given to this knowledge. So, systematised knowledge
      that humans have acquired through observations and experimentation may be
      referred to as science. Due to its vast expansion and variety of subjects,
      science has been further divided into many branches.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      One of the most significant fields of science is chemistry. Chemistry can
      be summed up as the area of science that studies matter, including its
      properties, composition, and the changes that occur to it as a result of
      various activities. Several branches of chemistry have been created based
      on the specialised disciplines of research.

    <h2>What is Chemistry?</h2>
    <p>
      Chemistry is a subdiscipline of science that deals with the study of
      matter and the substances that constitute it. It also deals with the
      properties of these substances and the reactions undergone by them to form
      new substances. Chemistry primarily focuses on atoms, ions, and molecules
      which, in turn, make up elements and compounds. These chemical species
      tend to interact with each other through chemical bonds. It is important
      to note that the interactions between matter and energy are also studied
      in the field of chemistry.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The study of elements and compounds’ properties, compositions, and
      structures, as well as how they can change and the energy that is released
      or absorbed during such changes, is the subject matter of the science
      known as chemistry.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Relationship Between Chemistry and Other Branches of Science</h2>
    <p>
      ‘Science’ can be defined as the systematic study of the natural universe,
      its structure, and everything it encompasses. Due to the immensity of the
      natural universe, science has been divided into several disciplines that
      deal with certain aspects of the universe. The three primary subcategories
      of science under which these disciplines can be grouped are:
    </p>
    <br />
    <b>.The Formal Sciences:</b>
    <p>
      Involves the study of the language disciplines that concern formal
      systems. Examples of scientific disciplines that fall under this category
      include logic and mathematics. Can be thought of as the “language of
      science”.
    </p>
    <br />
    <b>.The Natural Sciences:</b>
    <p>
      Involves the study of natural phenomena through experiments and
      observations. Chemistry, physics, and biology fall under this category of
      science.
    </p>
    <br />
    <b>The Social Sciences:</b>
    <p>
      Involves the study of human societies and the relationships between the
      humans that dwell in these societies. Examples of scientific disciplines
      that fall under this category include psychology, sociology, and
      economics.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the relationships between the major branches of science are
      considered, chemistry is found to lie close to the centre (as illustrated
      below).
    </p>
    <br />
    <div><img src="chemistry flowdigram.jpg" /></div>
    <p>
      Thus, chemistry can be viewed as a central science whose roots bore into
      several other subdisciplines of science.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Branches of Chemistry</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The five primary branches of chemistry are physical chemistry, organic
      chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and biochemistry.

      branch.

      Apart from these primary branches, there exist several specialized fields
      of chemistry that deal with cross-disciplinary matters. Some such examples
      include medicinal chemistry, neurochemistry, materials chemistry, nuclear
      chemistry, environmental chemistry, polymer chemistry, and
      thermochemistry.

    <h1><b>Examples of Chemistry in Our Daily Lives</b></h1>
    <p>
      Chemical reactions are constantly taking place around us. The human body
      facilitates thousands of chemical reactions every day. From the digestion
      of food to the movement of muscles – all bodily actions involve chemical
      reactions. A few other examples of chemistry in the day-to-day lives of
      humans are listed below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      .The process of photosynthesis that enables plants to convert water,
      sunlight, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen is a chemical
      reaction. This process is the foundation upon which the entire food chain
      is built.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      .Soaps and detergents used for hygiene work use a chemical process known
      as emulsification. Furthermore, they are produced using a chemical process
      known as saponification.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      .Even the sunscreen used by humans to protect themselves from the harmful
      UV-A and UV-B radiation of the sun is based on chemistry. These lotions
      and creams consist of a combination of inorganic and organic compounds
      that either filter or block the incoming ultraviolet radiation.
